Force directed network of WebKit kernel class dependencies

This is a network graphic for the WebKit dependencies. It shows the networks for the five major categories for the class dependencies for the WebKit kernel: HTMLElement, WebGL, SVG, CSS, and Other. The intent of the graphic is to show the deeply-interconnected nature of the WebKit kernel dependencies.

For interaction, click the category name in the legend (top-left corner) to toggle visibility on and off. For other visualization, click the graph type in the toolbox option (top-right corner).
